# haskell-raytrace

This is a Haskell program that implements a basic raytracer

The program should be imported into a ghci session. (:load raytrace)
The program is then started by calling the main function. (:run main)

The raytracer has a set screen size and camera position.
When the program runs, the user is prompted to enter the position of the light source and the position, radius and colour of the sphere to render. The user is also prompted to enter the filename of the output image file. The output image file is in ppm format.
